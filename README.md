This is a mini project for the Programming Paradigms CS course at the 2nd Year of Undergrad.

It is a C++ game created on TurboC++/ Dosbox. It makes use of C++ graphics.h header file, and works after linking with the BGI folder.

The main aim of the game is to stay alive as long as you can while dodging the incoming obstacles. The score will be based on the number of obstacles passed. As the score keeps increasing, so will the level of dificulty.
